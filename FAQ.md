**RedDoorLine.com FAQ**

**1. When is the site active?**

    The site is active typically from 5pm-2am provided Red Door is open. Before 5pm glare is excessive.

**2. Why is the image not updating?**

    Likely due to caching by your browser. If on a computer use (Ctrl/Cmd)+Shift+R to force refresh the cache.
    If on mobile or the previous step is not working, open an incognito tab/window to access the site.
    If neither of these solve your problem along with a history/cache clear, contact me.

**3. Why am I stuck on the denied screen?**

    Check your network. If you're on Caltech secure try completely quitting your browser and reopening.
    If still unable, even in an incognito window, reach out to me as I probably need to add your IP.

**4. How secure/private is the website?**

    I have setup a firewall which will only allow access if you are on the Caltech secure wifi network.
    Images are stored *only locally* as I may implement some ML processes to categorize the line length.

**5. Why and how did you do this?**

    I can look out the window and check the line - thought it would be nice to share.
    Runs on a Raspberry Pi 4 and camera. More than happy to bore with more technical details just shoot me an email.
