# RedDoorLine
Website &amp; Image Storage for RedDoorLine.com

When Red Door Cafe on Caltech's campus is open, this project takes a picture every 2 minutes
so students can efficiently take time off work to eat.

Honestly pretty jank. Using github pushes to update the photo. Delay ~45 seconds.

Commits wiped every day to prevent long term data collection. Still stored locally.

Operated off a Raspberry Pi4 with a Camera Module V2 in Page 142.
